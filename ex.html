The survey revealed that YSRCP was all set to form the next government in Andhra Pradesh and was likely to bag 121 to 130 MLAs seats. It also predicted that YSRCP led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy would get 21 Lok Sabha seats out of 25 in the state The CPS survey said that the TDP would be reduced to 3 to 4 Lok Sabha seats and 45 to 50 assembly seats. As for the Jana Sena Party led by actor Pawan Kalyan, the survey said it would be down to a seat or two, taking it completely out of the equation. CPS is headed by eminent psephologist Dr. Venugopala Rao and has earned national recognition for its scientific studies and surveys. It may be recalled that surveys conducted by CPS on the outcome of Telangana elections held in December 2018 proved to be accurateCPS conducted the poll surveys on Andhra Pradesh to gauge the mood of the people of the state, in two phases. The first survey was conducted from February 17-21 covering a sample size of four, 4,37,642 respondents. The second phase of the survey was conducted from March 27-31 with a sample size covering 3,04,323 respondents. In all, the responses of 7,41,965 were factored into the analysis to determine the results of the survey.Speaking to senior journalist TS Sudhir, Venugopal Rao of CPS spoke at length about various points related to the surveyWhat does your survey reveal on election results in Andhra Pradesh There is a powerful wave in favour of the YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh and led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, the party is set to form government in the state. In the survey conducted by us in February YSR CP got 4% more votes than TDP, in the fresh survey YSRCP surged forward with a lead of 80% over TDP. In 2014 YSRCP lost narrowly by 1.60%. With a lead of 8% now, the party is said to have a clear majority in the assembly elections, it can be said.YSRCP is likely to be ahead with about 48.1% of the vote share while TDP would be clearly about 7% behind on 40.1%, Jana Sena is likely to be a distant third with 8% of the vote share, while Congress and BJP may not have any significant impact on the electoral outcome');
